This is a repository with some examples of the projects I developed during my Master's Degree in Data Science.

### Active Learning
To solve a classification problem combining active learning and diversity algorithms using a SVM as a base classifer.
**Active Learning algorithms:**
<br>
+ Margin Sampling
+ Multi-Class Label Uncertainty
+ Significance Space Construction
+ Normalized Entropy Query Bagging
<br>

**Diversity algorithms:**
<br>
+ Most Ambiguous and Orthogonal
+ Multiclass Level Uncertainty-angle-based Diversity
+ Diversity by clustering
<br>

### Spark-MLlib Task
To load, process and evaluate different clustering and classification algorithms provided by the Spark MLlib library on the classic MNIST data set using Watson Studio.
